                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and an interactive map. All focus on an aspect of
                        culture and the way culture shapes our lives.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold"><i>What Is Culture?</i></span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on
                        the
                        needs of your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold"><i>What Is Culture?</i></span>
                        for
                        independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the
                        anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing
                        the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new
                        understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text structures and features appear across the texts in this set.

                            someone, you have an effect on them. Who are some people who <span

                        and an example. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">How would you define <span

                        structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “gives examples,”
                        “explains something”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Remind students that headings are bold words that

                            organize their ideas. Often, the headings help show what each section will be about.</span>
                        Have students preview the heading on screen 3 (Printable Text p. 2). Ask: <span

                        repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span

                        response: In both places, immigrants have influenced the local culture.)
                        <span class="blue_scripting">How are they different?</span> (Possible response: Immigrants came

                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What is culture?</i>
                        Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This text is about different ways people talk about culture.
                            Why is
                            it important to talk about culture? How does talking about culture help us understand what
                            it is?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span
                                class="bold">immigrants, ancestors,</span></i> and <i><span
                                class="bold">tradition.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">An ancestor is a relative or family member from long ago. What
                            do you know about your <span class="bold">ancestors,</span> or the ancestors of people you

                    <p> Some of the vocabulary in <i>How Do We Talk About Culture?</i>
                        might be new or challenging for students. During class discussions, use these new terms
                        repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">How do people <span class="bold">adapt</span> or adjust to life in a
                            new place? Why do people
                            <span class="bold">compare</span> the United States to a melting pot? How have immigrants
                            <span class="bold">influenced</span>, or changed,
                            their communities? </span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">VOCABULARY FOUR-SQUARE</span></h3>
                    <p>Review with students how to make a vocabulary four-square, with a vocabulary word in the center.
                        Explain the four other elements of the square: a definition of the word, an example of the word
                        in a sentence, a synonym or antonym, and an example. Tell students to complete a four-square
                        diagram for <i>ancestors</i>, based on the text. Invite them to use reference materials if
                        needed. A
                        completed four-square might look like this: </p>
                    <!-- <p>[a word web with <i>moon</i> in the center, and with <i>full moon, month, phases, sky,</i> and <i>season</i> branching from it]</p> -->

                        structure. Remind students that when authors compare, they show how two things are similar. When
                        they contrast, they show how two things are different. Direct students to screen 8 (Printable
                        Text p. 6) and have them
                        read the first sentence. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Which word shows that the author is
                            contrasting two things?</span> (<i>unlike</i>) Identify other clue words for comparisons and
                        contrasts, such as <i>like, similarly</i>, and <i>different</i>. Ask students to look for these
                        words as they read.</p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Compare and Contrast
                        Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about
                        compare and contrast structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For
                        example: “explains how things are similar and different”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Have students preview the images and captions on screen 4
                        (Printable Text p. 3).

                            culture in the United States. Some people say that the country is like a melting pot. How do

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Photographs.” Work with the class to
                        fill in the column with examples of how photos help readers understand the text. For example:
                        “help readers understand ideas”</p>

                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What is culture?</i>
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What do you think the word <i>cross-cultural</i> means? Can
                            someone have more than one culture?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <span
                            class="bold"><i>cross-cultural, immigrant</i></span>, and <span
                            class="bold"><i>identity.</i></span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">If you go to another country on vacation, are you an <span
                                class="bold">immigrant</span>? How many cultures are in a <span

                            You may wish to explain the difference between “multicultural” (a word used to describe a
                            society with multiple different cultures) and “cross-cultural” (which usually describes a
                            person or society with two or more main cultures). Often, <i>cross-cultural</i> refers to a
                            deeper connection or comparison between cultures.

                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Cross-Cultural Kids</i> might be new or challenging for students.
                        During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with
                        them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">How might cross-cultural kids <span
                                class="bold">contribute</span> to their communities? How do they <span

                    <p>Review with students how to create a vocabulary four-square with a vocabulary word in the center.
                        Explain the four elements around the word: a definition, an example of the word in a sentence, a
                        synonym or antonym, and an example. Tell students to complete a four-square diagram for
                        <i>cross-cultural</i> on a sheet of paper, based on the text. Invite them to use reference
                        materials if needed. A completed four-square might look like this:</p>

                    <p>Have students interview an adult in their life, such as a parent, grandparent, or neighbor.
                        Students should ask about the adult’s culture and how elements of the culture play a role in
                        his or her life. Remind students to review what they wrote in the Write About the Big
                        Question for other texts to help them think of questions to ask. They may also use the <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="activitySupport"

                        Students should share audio
                        and a written report about the interview. Encourage them to use vocabulary they learned from
                        the texts in their writing. You may wish to compile all of the interviews in a class book.

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span class="solidl"
                            aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
