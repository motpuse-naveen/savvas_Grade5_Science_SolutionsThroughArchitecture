                    <p>This text set includes five informational texts. The texts provide
                        information about problems that have been solved by architects in the past and the present, as
                        well as problems architects are solving for the future.</p>
                    <p><i><span class="bold">The Importance of Architecture</span></i> is the anchor text for this set.
                        Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <i><span class="bold">The
                                Importance of Architecture</span></i> for independent reading, or you may choose to read
                        it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and
                        academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other
                        texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and
                        features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the table below to see where
                        specific text features and text structures appear across the texts in this set.

                            do architects overcome challenges?</i>
                        Say: <span class="blue_scripting">An architect is someone who designs buildings, or plans how
                            they will look. How do you think <i>The Importance of Architecture</i> will help you think
                            about the Big Question? What are some problems or challenges that architects face, and how
                            do you think they solve them?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that include the words <i><span
                            class="bold">architecture, durable, </span></i> and <i><span class="bold">structure.</span></i>
                        Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting"> <span
                                class="bold">Architecture</span> is the art of planning or designing buildings. What are
                            some examples of architecture? If something is <span class="bold">durable</span>, it is
                            strong and will last. What are some durable things you can think of? A <span
                                class="bold">structure</span> is something that is built, such as a house or a bridge.
                            What is another example of a structure?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span><br> Some of the vocabulary in <i>The

                        discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For
                        example: <span class="blue_scripting">Why is the <span class="bold">design</span> of a building
                            important? What kind of building would you want to design? </p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Cluster Diagram</span></h3>
                    <p>Display a cluster diagram graphic organizer made up of a central circle with lines and
                        additional circles extending from the central circle. Write the word <i>architecture</i> in the
                        largest circle. As the class reads the text, have students add a word related to architecture in
                        another circle branching off from the largest one, and add additional circles with related words
                        or examples. Model how to branch out different parts of the diagram to show connections between
                        words. A sample diagram might look like this:

                        written with a descriptive structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">A text written with a

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Photographs are

                            the parts of a structure.</span> Direct students’ attention to the photograph of the pagoda.
                        Point out the caption or clickable hotspots, and ask a student to read the text aloud. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does the photo help you
                            understand about pagodas? Why do you think the author chose to include the picture instead
                            of only describing this structure? </span> </p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the right column, write “Photographs.”
                        Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about photographs and how they help

                        design and building materials.</p>

                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s3_3">Before Reading</h2>
                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span><br> Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How
                            do architects overcome challenges?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think
                            <i>Learning from Ancient Architects</i> will help you think about the Big Question? How
                            might styles or materials from ancient architecture help architects today?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the following words: <i><span
                            class="bold">materials, design,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">structure.</span></i> Discuss the
                        meaning of each word with the class. Say:<span class="blue_scripting"> What <span
                                class="bold">materials</span> might you use for an art project? What kind of building
                            would you like to <span class="bold">design</span> or plan? What kinds of <span
                                class="bold">structures</span> do you think an ancient architect might build?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span><br> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Learning
                            from Ancient Architects</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class
                        discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. Say:
                        <span class="blue_scripting"><span class="bold">Durable</span> material is strong. Why would an
                            architect want to use durable materials?</span></p>
                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Cluster Diagram</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a cluster diagram and have students create diagrams of their own. In a
                        circle, write <i>architecture</i>, and add a connected circle with the words <i>influence of
                            ancient styles</i>. As the class reads the text, have students add details. Model how to
                        branch out different parts of the diagram to show connections between related words and ideas. A
                        sample diagram might look like this:

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that <i>Learning from Ancient Architects</i> is
                        written with a compare and contrast structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This writer
                            describes similarities and differences between ancient and modern buildings. As you read,
                            look for clue words that show you are reading about a comparison or contrast.</span> Read
                        the first two paragraphs of the <span class="bold">Roman Architecture</span> section. Ask: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">Which words show that the author is comparing two things, or showing
                            how they are similar? </span>(Sample responses: <i>another, similar</i>)</p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Compare and Contrast
                        Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about a compare and
                        contrast structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “helps
                        show similarities between different styles or times in history,” “helps show how today is
                        different from the past”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Photographs are important
                            features in many texts. They can give new information or help the reader understand
                            information in the text.</span>
                        Direct students' attention to the photos of the Parthenon and the Lincoln Memorial. Say: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">The design of the Lincoln Memorial was influenced by Greek building
                            styles. Look at both photographs. What similarities do you see?</span></p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Photographs.” Work with the class to
                        fill in the column with what they know about how photographs help
                        them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “help show similarities between different
                        styles or times in history,” “help show how today is different from the past”</p>

                    <p>This text examines environmental problems that can be created by many types of structures. It
                        details specific methods for solving those problems and helping the environment.</p>
                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s4_3">Before Reading</h2>
                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span><br> Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How
                            do architects overcome challenges?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think
                            <i>Green Architecture</i> will help you think about the Big Question? What are some
                            environmental challenges that architects might face? How could they solve these problems?
                        </span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the following words: <i><span
                            class="bold">
                            modern</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">efficient.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of
                        each word with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">When something is <span
                                class="bold">modern</span>, it’s associated with life or styles today. What kinds of
                            buildings look modern to you? When a home is <span class="bold">efficient</span>,
                            it uses less energy. How might someone build an efficient home?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span><br> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Green
                            Architecture</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions,
                        use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">How can architects create buildings that are both beautiful and <span class="bold">functional?</span></span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Cluster Diagram</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a cluster diagram as shown below and have students copy the structure on a
                        piece of paper. In the largest circle, write <i>architecture</i>. Add another circle with a
                        description or characteristic of green architecture, such as <i>energy-efficient features</i>.
                        Add other circles with related words or examples. Point out that students will add to their
                        diagrams during reading as the class discusses vocabulary words. A sample diagram might look
                        like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>[Insert web/cluster graphic with circles and words as shown below. Ignore the rectangles; those

                        with a problem and solution structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This structure
                            identifies a problem and explains one or more ways to solve the problem. Green architecture
                            is architecture that does not harm the environment. What is one problem it might

                        solution structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “describes
                        an important problem or issue,” “tells how a problem could be solved”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Charts can be extremely useful features in a text. They can clarify information, and they can also add information that will emphasize important points in a text.</span> Direct students’ attention to the pie charts on screen 2 (Printable Text p. x). Have a volunteer read aloud the title of each chart. As necessary, remind students of the way to read and understand a pie chart. Ask: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">Why do you think the author included these charts with the text?</span> Encourage responses such as the following: <i>The charts help the writer support the idea that homes need to be designed to use less energy.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write "Charts." Work with the class to
                        fill in the column with what they know about how charts help them understand a writer’s ideas.
                        For example: “help readers visualize or picture information”

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How do architects overcome challenges?</i>
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What challenges do you think today’s architects face? How do you think they solve problems?
                        </span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the following words: <i><span class="bold">
                        materials, futuristic,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">structure.</span></i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">What are some <span class="bold">materials</span> that architects use? What is an example of a modern <span class="bold">structure</span> in our area? If something is <span class="bold">futuristic</span>, it looks like it is from the future. What would a futuristic home look like?
                        </span>

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Modern Architects</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">What kinds of <span class="bold">designs</span> provide features that are good for the environment? Which photo looks the most <span class="bold">futuristic</span> to you?</span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold">Cluster Diagram</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a cluster diagram and have students create their own diagrams in a notebook or on a sheet of paper. In the largest circle, write <i>Architecture</i>. For one line extending from the web, write <i>modern styles</i>. Add examples of modern styles around the diagram. A sample diagram might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>[a word web with <i>moon</i> in the center, and with <i>full moon, month, phases, sky,</i> and <i>season</i> branching from it]</p> -->
                    <p>[Insert web/cluster graphic with circles and words as shown below. Ignore the rectangles; those were only added to insert the text. Go-by appears below. These are the words in the diagram:] architecture	modern styles	futuristic designs		energy efficient</p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Compare and Contrast Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about compare and contrast structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “tells how people and things are similar and different”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">
                        Captions help give more information about the photos in a text.
                    </span> Preview the photos and captions, such as the picture of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What additional information does this caption help you understand?</span>  (Sample response: when the museum was completed)</p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Captions.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about how captions help them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “give more information about the photos in a text”</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i> How do architects overcome challenges?</i>
                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Cities of the Future</i> will help you think about the Big Question?
                        </span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the following words and phrases: <i><span
                            class="bold">construct, insulate,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">design.</span></i>
                            Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: 
                        <span class="blue_scripting">How do architects decide how a home should be <span class="bold">constructed</span>? When you <span class="bold">insulate</span> a building, you help it hold heat inside. In what areas of the country would it make sense to insulate a building from heat? Buildings are <span class="bold">efficient</span> when they use less energy. Why might an architect want to <span class="bold">design</span> an energy-efficient building?</span>

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Cities of the Future</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">self-sufficient</span> person is able to be independent and not rely on help from others. What do you think a self-sufficient city would be like?</span> </p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Cluster Diagram</span></h3>
                    <p>Demonstrate creating a cluster diagram, and have students make their own diagrams in their notebooks or on a piece of paper. Use the model shown below. In the largest circle, write <i>architecture</i>. Add another circle with <i>futuristic architecture</i> or <i>futuristic features</i>. Encourage students to add vocabulary words related to future cities to their cluster diagrams as they read, and to use lines in the webs to show the connections between words. A sample diagram might look like this:</p>
                    <p>[ Insert web/cluster graphic. Go-by appears below.]

                        Read the first two paragraphs of the text. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What do you think this text will describe?</span> Encourage students to identify details and examples that add to the description.

                    </p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Descriptive Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about descriptive structure, and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “uses details and examples to help readers understand something”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span>  Say:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">You’ve read many texts with headings. These are phrases or sentences in bold print above a section of the text. They provide a preview of the information you are about to read in a specific section of a text.</span> Point out the bold heading <span class="bold">Smart Technology in Lighting</span>. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does this heading tell you about the information you are preparing to read?
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the right column, write “Headings.” Help students fill in the column with information about how headings help readers understand a text. For example: “explain the topic or main idea of a section"

                    <p>Tell students: The future has arrived! You are an architect, and you are planning a design for a city.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>Write a plan telling your design for the city.</li>
                        <li>Include at least three diagrams to show the ways you will solve problems that cities often experience. Include labels for your diagrams.</li>
                        <li>Create a sketch or a computer-generated image to show your city of the future.</li>
                        <li>Write at least four paragraphs. In your paragraphs, do the following:
                            <ul class="small-dashed">
                                <li>Discuss reasons and evidence to show why your design plan will be helpful to the environment.</li>
                                <li>Clearly explain details of your design plan.
                                </li>
                                <li>Persuade others of the importance of following your design plan.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <p>Students can refer to information they have written in <i>Write About the Big Question</i> for each text to aid their thinking and planning. Students may use the <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="activitySupport"
                            popupref="popup-ar-31">Project Template</a> to help them organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their projects. Encourage students to use the vocabulary they’ve learned from the texts.</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Prepare to Share</span></h3>
                    <p>Provide time for students to practice sharing their culminating project. If they are working 
                        with a partner, remind them to work collaboratively and follow agreed upon rules, norms, and protocols.</p>
                    <p>Use the bulleted points below to model good speaking and listening skills.</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>When I share my project, I look at the audience. I don't keep my eyes down.</li>

                        <li>I pronounce each word clearly and correctly.</li>
                        <li>I do not rush, but speak clearly and at a natural pace.</li>
                        <li>I pay attention with my eyes and ears when others are speaking. </li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">Celebrate!</span></h3>

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span class="solidl"
                            aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
